# Discount_Mart_Sales_Analytics_using_Tableau
Discount mart is a small Dashboard where we can track how well Discount Mart is doing for a particular year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold).
We would also like to know how well categories are performing overall and in different regions of US.
After doing the analysis of data we found out that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order.
Assuming that Profit is 30% of the selling price.
